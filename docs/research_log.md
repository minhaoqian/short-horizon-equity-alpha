# Research Log

This log records design decisions, rejected alternatives, data issues, failed hypotheses, and material changes. Entries should be written before or at the time a research decision is made where possible.

## RL-001 — Project initiated
**Date:** 2026-10-02

**Decision:** Initiate Project 2 under the working title *Short-Horizon Equity Alpha Forecasting and Cost-Aware Market-Neutral Portfolio Construction*.

**Primary question:** Can short-horizon cross-sectional equity forecasts generate economically meaningful market-neutral alpha after realistic risk controls and transaction costs?

**Rationale:** The project is intended to simulate a research workflow closer to a systematic equity desk than a generic stock-prediction exercise.

## RL-002 — Research architecture
**Date:** 2026-10-02

**Decision:** Treat forecasting, portfolio construction, risk controls, transaction costs, and PnL attribution as separate research layers.

**Rejected framing:** single-stock price prediction.

**Reason:** The economic object of interest is cross-sectional implementable alpha, not directional prediction of one ticker.

---

## RL-003 — Primary market data
**Date:** 2026-10-02

**Decision:** Use CRSP CIZ daily US stock data as the core market-data backbone.

**Rationale:** Permanent identifiers, inactive securities, returns, prices, volume, market capitalisation, and corporate-action information make it appropriate for point-in-time historical research.

**Extension:** Compustat/CCM may be added only after the CRSP-only pipeline is stable.

---

## RL-004 — Primary horizon
**Date:** 2026-10-02

**Decision:** Set the primary forecast horizon to five trading days.

**Rationale:** This remains short-horizon while reducing some of the noise and extreme turnover pressure associated with a one-day target.

**Robustness horizons:** 1D and 10D may be examined later, but are secondary specifications.

## RL-005 — Execution convention not yet locked
**Date:** 2026-10-02

**Candidate:** signal after close t, execution at open t+1.

**Status:** conditional.

**Required evidence:** empirical CRSP opening-price coverage within the eventual liquid universe.

**Fallback:** execute no earlier than close t+1 with a correspondingly shifted label.

**Integrity rule:** execution convention must not be selected based on realised strategy performance.

---

## RL-006 — Universe thresholds not yet locked
**Date:** 2026-10-02

**Candidate filters:** price > $5, market cap > $1bn, 20-day ADV > $20m.

**Status:** conditional on distribution and coverage diagnostics.

**Integrity rule:** thresholds will be justified by implementability and sample quality, not Sharpe maximisation.

---

## RL-007 — Current stage
**Date:** 2026-10-02

**Stage:** 1A — CRSP extraction and data QA.

**Permitted work:** schema verification, extraction design, coverage diagnostics, eligibility logic, missingness checks, delisting checks.

**Not permitted yet:** model training or portfolio backtesting.

---

## RL-008 — CRSP CIZ market-cap unit verified
**Date:** 2026-10-02

**Finding:** Official CRSP CIZ documentation defines `DlyCap` as daily market capitalisation reported in thousands of dollars.

**Implication:** A $1bn threshold maps to `DlyCap > 1,000,000` in the native CRSP field, not `1,000,000,000`.

**Action:** Corrected the Stage 1A QA utility and documented the unit convention explicitly.

**Research-control lesson:** Source units must be verified before any universe filter or feature is operationalised.


---

## RL-009 — WRDS daily extraction schema confirmed
**Date:** 2026-10-02

**Finding:** The CIZ Daily Stock File web query exposes the core fields required for Stage 1A, including PERMNO/PERMCO, daily OHLC/price fields, total/price/income returns, volume, bid/ask, market capitalisation, delisting flag, price-adjustment factor, and ordinary/non-ordinary dividend amounts.

**Non-issue:** Several optional cumulative adjustment / return-quality variables considered during planning are not exposed in this query form. They are not necessary for Stage 1A data-quality testing and do not justify delaying the extraction.

**Implementation note:** WRDS web exports use lowercase variable names. Repository QA code was aligned to the actual export schema.

**Query decision:** Proceed with the full 1993–2025 entire-database daily extraction with no universe filters applied in WRDS.
